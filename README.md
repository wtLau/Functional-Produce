# Asynchronous Programming Playground

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Both `src/callbacks.js` and `src/promises.js` can be run with vanilla Node.

```bash
node src/callbacks.js
node src/promises.js
```

`/src/await.js` uses some ES7 capabilities, so we need to transpile it with WebPack. To run, use:

```bash
npm run await
```
